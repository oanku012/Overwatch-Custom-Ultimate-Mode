-crashes when swapping player to other team
-should try to fix mccree being able to interrupt his ult by firing. not sure if his voice line would still play if I just stunned or froze him shortly afterwards.


Usingcustomult subroutine, might need to remove some stuff from it that doesn't affect all heroes with custom ults:
Destroy Effect(Event Player.UltEffect);
        Event Player.UsingCustomUlt = null;
        Destroy HUD Text(Event Player.UltReadyText);
		Event Player.UltReadyText = Null;
		Set Ultimate Ability Enabled(Event Player, True);
		Event Player.B = Null;
		Stop Chasing Player Variable(Event Player, G);
		Event Player.G = 0;
		Destroy HUD Text(Last Text ID);
		Set Primary Fire Enabled(Event Player, True);
		Set Secondary Fire Enabled(Event Player, True);
		Set Damage Dealt(Event Player, 100);
		Set Max Health(Event Player, 100);
		Destroy Effect(Event Player.Y);
		Event Player.Y = 0;
		Stop Camera(Event Player);
