Issues/optimization:
-crashes when swapping player to other team
-should try to fix mccree being able to interrupt his ult by firing. not sure if his voice line would still play if I just stunned or froze him shortly afterwards. Then again maybe it's okay to leave it as is?
-if mccree cancels his ult manually, the description text won't be removed, also seems to happen if he just doesn't fire. Though I'll probably make a new way of showing the ult descriptions in the future with a manual button press. edit: apparently the code currently checks for if the enemy players have ulting enemy mccree set when disabling the ult, so if enemy team is empty then the ult text will never be removed, will modify
-multiple mccrees per team don't apply damage correctly as the code is only designed for one per team
-roadhog and maybe some other stuns can cancel d.vas freezing when choosing from menu
-checking for ability 2 cooldown always returns 0 with dva which is why the cooldown for her microrockets isn't changed, could potentially use the hard value from the wiki for the cooldown and then calculate based on that and also do the cooldown reduction a specific number of seconds after she started firing the rockets, but might have to set some extra variables for that or use d.vas array variable, or maybe the devs will fix it eventually who knows
-sigma code sometimes leaves allies flying, also several sigma rules related to him setting gravity on players executing even when there hasn't been any sigma playing
-sometimes if doomfists meteor strikes hit multiple enemies they seem to be sent flying in the same direction regardless of where they're standing
-sombra's time stop doesn't seem to work on players if they spawn during the time stop
-could maybe remove some unnecessary variables from use like ones used for timers and such
-soldier can use multiple killstreaks at once if they're unlocked, also can use other streaks when in ac-130 for example
-seems like sometimes the number of kills counted by the game for soldier's streak is more than the amount counted by the code?
-nuke increases respawn time for bots? and maybe players?
-zarya team 2 the graviton surge doesn't move
-sometimes zarya's graviton effect doesn't get removed after ult ends and just gets placed in the middle of the map
-torbturret disappears when AI bots are added to the same team, dunno if the same would happen with dummy bots and players, edit: seems like the torb maybe just gets replaced on his slot instead of being moved up a slot. Probably should have to specify a slot that is not used by players or AI.
-winston's wall stun seems to work most of the time, but sometimes it doesn't, seems like the J variable might not be set correctly sometimes when winston deals damage?
-for some reason with zarya the enemies are now flying in long circles around the grav when I reworked the code even though functionally I don't see how it should be any different from before
-moira's ult knockback applies impulse in the direction of players within radius which doesn't really work with multiple players

Stuff to add/change:
-add visual effect to roadhog reflecting stuff
-sigma making gravity stronger on enemies when closer seems kinda counterintuitive when he's able to fly, some alternate way of increasing their gravity could be nice
-maybe somehow stop symmetra from spawning portals out of bounds
-maybe enable reaper's guns, but just teleport him out of bounds if he stays there while not in wraith form, edit: for some reason I remember having had reaper teleport in bounds after ult ends, but apparently that's not in there.
-could maybe try using resurrect with brigitte instead of changing hero

-maybe with zenyatta could create a dummy bot that copies their moves while the actual possessed player is invisible so that the zenyatta can damage their allies, or maybe the zenyatta himself could transform into the enemy hero. Could use force player outline or whatever that is to still make the zen look like an ally.
-problem with this solution is that the skin might be different for the character between players
-could maybe do the whole thing in a sort of opposite way where the zenyatta just turns into the enemy hero and instead of zen's camera seeing the enemy's perspective, the enemy sees zen's perspective during the possession and the enemy is invisible and phased out like zen is right now. This way I actually wouldn't even have to replicate the move-set like the code currently does. And this way the zen possessing could damage the enemy's team.
-maybe a dummy bot would be the best solution so that the zen player won't take all the damage, although maybe that's not necessarily too bad


-could potentially use projectiles with widow's ult to get more accurate hits? also maybe for soldier's ac-130 though it works okay without it as well, I'm not sure it currently accounts for how far the player is from the explosion which projectiles could do though it can be coded manually too. The projectiles could maybe break shields and turrets too?
-could maybe add a secondary fire to the ac-130
-could maybe come up with something else for Ana. Soldier's care package already sets cooldowns to 0

-for tracer could maybe speed up projectile speed to make it like made in heaven lol

-maybe add some kind of global array that keeps track of all effects and destroys them if the player leaves the match or something or after a certain amount of time

-could maybe use is true for any  to check if any of the enemy players has variable set and then set stuff on the event player

-add dummy bot checks for all ults

-should maybe set pharah's hud text during ult into a variable so it is deleted correctly

Usingcustomult subroutine, might need to remove some stuff from it that doesn't affect all heroes with custom ults:
Destroy Effect(Event Player.UltEffect);
        Event Player.UsingCustomUlt = null;
        Destroy HUD Text(Event Player.UltReadyText);
		Event Player.UltReadyText = Null;
		Set Ultimate Ability Enabled(Event Player, True);
		Event Player.B = Null;
		Stop Chasing Player Variable(Event Player, G);
		Event Player.G = 0;
		Destroy HUD Text(Last Text ID);
		Set Primary Fire Enabled(Event Player, True);
		Set Secondary Fire Enabled(Event Player, True);
		Set Damage Dealt(Event Player, 100);
		Set Max Health(Event Player, 100);
		Destroy Effect(Event Player.Y);
		Event Player.Y = 0;
		Stop Camera(Event Player);
